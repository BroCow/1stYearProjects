    <hr>
    <p>In this lab, you will be the AHJ determining if the installation method is (a) installed properly or not and you must (b) cite your source from the NEC code book with the exception of stations 8 – 10.</p>
    <p>No, the J-hook support is positioned further than 3 feet apart. Unless we knew the manufacturer’s specifications for support.</p>
    <h3 class="center">i.e., a properly cited source</h3>

    <h2>Station 1: Horizontal Support</h2>
    <img src="images/Station1HorizontalSupport.JPG" alt="cable support">
    <p>Utilizing a tape measure, is this station’s horizontal support (J-Hooks) length IAW the NEC code book? If not installed properly, what is wrong?</p>
    <p>No, the J-hook support is positioned further than 3 feet apart. Unless we knew the manufacturer’s specifications for support.</p>

    <h2>Station 2: Plenum Space and Cable Routing</h2>
    <img src="images/Station2PlenumSpaceCableRating.JPG" alt="plenum">
    <p>Is this area defined as plenum space? Based on your findings, would the cable located on top of the cable tray be acceptable for use IAW the NEC code book? If not installed properly, what is wrong?</p>
    <p>No, this area is not defined as plenum space because it is not a compartment or chamber (ceiling tile or raised floor would be a compartment or chamber). The cable used is riser rated which would be fine for this installation.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Station 3: Fill Ratio</h2>
    <img src="images/Station3FillRatio.JPG" alt="plenum">
    <p>According to the NEC, is the raceway fill ratio for communications wires and cables being exceeded in the EMT?</p>
    <p>No, IAW the NEC, there are no requirements for the ratio fill.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Station 4: EMT Cable Support</h2>
    <img src="images/Station4EMTCableSupport.JPG" alt="plenum">
    <p>Is this station’s cable secured properly to the chase IAW the NEC code book? If not installed properly, what is wrong?</p>
    <p>No, the EMT was designed for cable to be placed inside, not taped or strapped to the outside. Also, the cable is preventing the removal of panel.</p>

    <h2>Station 5: Abandoned Cable</h2>
    <img src="images/Station5AbandonedCable.JPG" alt="plenum">
    <p>Is this station’s abandoned cable installed IAW the NEC code book? Does this cable meet the definition of accessible as applied to wiring methods? If not installed properly, what is wrong? </p>
    <p>No, the accessible portion of the cable needs to be removed. Yes, this cable is capable of being removed without damaging the building structure or finish and is not permanently closed in by the structure or finish.</p>

    <h2>Station 6: Separation of Conductors</h2>
    <img src="images/Station6SeparationofConductors.JPG" alt="plenum">
    <p>Are this station’s cable conductors installed IAW the NEC code book? If not installed properly, what is wrong?</p>
    <p>No, the communication cable shall not be placed in any raceway with NPL fire-alarm cable.</p>

    <h2>Station 7: Grounding Size</h2>
    <img src="images/Station7GroundingSize.JPG" alt="plenum">
    <p>According to NEC Article 800, would this grounding cable size be suitable for general use?</p>
    <p>Yes, the grounding conductor is fine because it shall not exceed 6 AWG and not be smaller than 14 AWG.</p>

    <h2>Station 8: Cable Termination</h2>
    <p>Are these station’s cables terminated properly, if not, what is wrong?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Termination 1:</li>
        <img src="images/Station8CableTermination1.JPG" alt="">
        <p>The cable is inserted wrong/ Jacket is stripped too short.</p>
        <br>
        <li>Termination 2:</li>
        <img src="images/Station8CableTermination2.JPG" alt="">
        <p>Can't tell for sure without seeing the color guide on the side.</p>
        <br>
        <li>Termination 3:</li>
        <img src="images/Station8CableTermination3.JPG" alt="">
        <p>Can't tell for sure without seeing the color guide on the side.</p>
        <br>
        <li>Termination 4:</li>

    <h2>Station 9: Firestopping Procedure</h2>
    <img src="images/Station9FirestoppingProcedure.JPG" alt="">
    <p>Is this station’s firestop installed properly? If not installed properly, what is wrong?  </p>
    <p>No, it needs to be installed in conjunction with ceramic fiber, rock wool filler or another approved fill material, plus it is not sealed properly (possible fell into the hole by now).</p>
    <hr>


    <h2>Station 10: Color Code</h2>
    <img src="images/Station10ColorCode.JPG" alt="">
    <p>Is this 110-block terminated properly, if not, what is wrong?</p>
    <p>Hard to see in this picture, but the Violet/Brown pair is swapped.</p>
