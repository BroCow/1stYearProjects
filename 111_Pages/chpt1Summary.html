    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <div class="pageMain">
        
        <p>In the past, the cabling installed within commercial buildings for computer systems was application-dependent to the computer system being used.
        Every time there was an update of the computer system being used, new cable had to be installed that would work with the new system. Eventually, this 
        created a <q>cable jungle</q> within buildings and pathways were congested.</p>

        <p>The purpose of a structured cabling system is to provide a standard method of installing cabling within buildings to support a variety of low-voltage 
            systems such as voice/data, CATV, video surveillance, and audio/visual.
